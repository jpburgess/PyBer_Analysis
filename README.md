# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to investigate ride share data for different city types.

## Results

### Summary Dataframe

Looking at the average fare per driver we can clearly see that, on average, drivers make more per ride the less densly populated the city type.  This is balanced by the fact that there are more rides available the more densely populated the city type.  

### Total Fare by City Type

![plot](Analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

This chart shows the clear differences in total fare between the city types.  Even though the average ride in urban areas has nearly a third less fare than rural rides the total amount of rides in urban areas more than makes up for that difference.  

## Summary Reccomendations

- Rural areas have high individual fare but low volume.  This city type is more suited to 'one and done' rides.  For example drivers could be encouraged to give a single ride after work on their way home.
- Urban areas have low individual fares but high volume.  Drivers in urban areas should be encouraged to give multiple rides in a row or to give short rides when they have time throughout the day.
- Suburban areas are a balance between the two types and therefore both the urban and rural reccomendations could apply.
